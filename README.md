This project is a simple implementation of a Blackjack game in Java, following a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. The game consists of a set of classes representing cards, players, and the game logic itself.

## Project Structure 📂

The project structure follows Maven conventions and consists of the following main components:

- **`src/main/java/alejandro/arzola/saavedra/david/blackjack`**: Contains the source code for the Blackjack game.
- **`src/test/java/alejandro/arzola/saavedra/david/blackjack`**: Contains the test cases for the Blackjack game.

## How to Build 🛠️

This project uses Maven as a build tool. To build the project, you can use the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This will compile the source code, run the tests, and package the application into a JAR file.

## How to Run ▶️

As the project is a library for a Blackjack game, there is no standalone application. You can, however, use the classes provided in the `src/test/java` directory to create your own Blackjack game scenarios.

## Testing 🧪

The project includes a set of JUnit tests located in the `src/test/java` directory. These tests cover various aspects of the Blackjack game logic, including determining winners, calculating the sum of bets, and handling special card combinations.<br>

To run the tests, you can use the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn test
```

## Sample Tests 🎮

The `BlackjackTest` class in the `src/test/java` directory contains sample tests for various scenarios, including determining winners based on card values and checking for special combinations like Blackjack.
